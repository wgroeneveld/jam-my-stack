I pulled the Google plug and installed LineageOS: <a href="https://brainbaking.com/post/2021/03/getting-rid-of-tracking-using-lineageos/" rel="ugc">https://brainbaking.com/post/2021/03/getting-rid-of-tracking-using-lineageos/</a> Very impressed so far! Also rely on my own CalDAV server to replace GCalendar. Any others here running <a class="hashtag" data-tag="lineageos" href="https://chat.brainbaking.com/tag/lineageos" rel="tag ugc">#lineageos</a> for privacy reasons?
