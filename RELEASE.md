# Jam-my-stack release notes

### 1.1.0

- Finally get rid of `utcOffset` and include timezone in proper ISO8601 format in `date` front-matter.
- This means this release will probably cause filenames to change so watch out! 

### 1.0.17

- Implement @http... translation to `context` front-matter in Markdown output.

### 1.0.16

- All the rest!
